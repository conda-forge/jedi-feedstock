  summary: An autocompletion tool for Python that can be used for text editors.
  description: |
    Jedi is a static analysis tool for Python that can be used in IDEs/editors.
    Its historic focus is autocompletion, but does static analysis for now as
    well. Jedi is fast and is very well tested. It understands Python on a
    deeper level than all other static analysis frameworks for Python.
